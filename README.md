# Interpretable Sommelier
Using the Wine Quality dataset from Kaggle that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarshde/wine-quality-dataset/data) and models from the imodels package, I try to create a model that will predict wine quality based on its features. Since we want to know what makes the wine good, we extract the rules for inspection.
